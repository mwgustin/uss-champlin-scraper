This is a simple web scraper designed to parse the static pages of the usschamplin.com crew pages and convert them to a usable format (json, database, etc).

Original pages are hardcoded/static pages with some inconsistencies. This is the first step of rewriting these crew pages so they can be driven by a database for consistency and ease of management.
